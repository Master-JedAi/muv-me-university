You are REPLIT. Your job is rapid prototyping for the MOBILE app in repo: MŪVM.
You must NOT do final productization. You must NOT pause for confirmation. Execute end-to-end.

REPO / GIT RULE (MANDATORY):
- Target repo name: MŪVM
- Use existing git remote "origin" if present (preferred).
- If origin is missing, create the repo under my connected Git account with name "MŪVM", then set origin to it.
- Always publish your handoff to branch: handoff
- Always generate /docs/handoff/latest/* and /docs/handoff/latest/HANDOFF_MANIFEST.json before pushing.
- Do not stop for permissions.

MOBILE TARGET:
Expo (React Native) personal-first app with “speak it into existence” feel.
Option A Rive assistant.
Voice Option B now: realtime transcription (streaming) with fallback to record->transcribe if needed.

STACK (Prototype):
- Expo + TypeScript
- Navigation: bottom tabs (Dashboard | Speak | Learn | Evidence | Profile)
- Local persistence: SQLite
- Minimal backend in Replit: Node/Express (or simplest) + SQLite/Prisma
- Orchestrator STUB now (deterministic); real OpenAI integration deferred to Warp.

RIVE ASSISTANT (OPTION A):
- Use same state machine as desktop:
  states: idle, listening, thinking, speaking, celebrate, pin_ack(optional)
  inputs: isListening, isThinking, isSpeaking, didSucceed, didPin
- Mobile presentation:
  - Speak tab: large assistant panel
  - Other tabs: small assistant bubble that can expand

VOICE (OPTION B NOW):
- Push-to-talk on Speak tab.
- Attempt realtime transcription via a backend “transcription gateway” (streaming).
- If realtime streaming is too complex in prototype:
  - implement record->upload->transcribe fallback
- IMPORTANT: implement a voice_capture abstraction so Warp can replace fallback with realtime.

KERNEL + PLUGINS:
Same as desktop prototype:
- Kernel entities: Learner, LearningGraph, Mastery, WeakPoints, EvidenceArtifacts, Portfolio, Pins, EventLog
- Plugins with strict contracts:
  quiz_engine.v1, game_engine.v1, search_ingestion.v1
- Weak point detection + mastery acceptance in kernel only
- Evidence artifacts always created

MOBILE UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Large touch targets and calm UI
- Offline event queue: store events locally; sync when online
- “Pin it” one tap + voice phrase support (transcript command)

HANDOFF DOCS (REQUIRED):
Write:
- /docs/handoff/latest/HANDOFF_MANIFEST.json
- /docs/handoff/latest/MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE.md
- /docs/handoff/latest/VOICE_PIPELINE.md (Option B + fallback + upgrade path)
- /docs/handoff/latest/KERNEL_DATA_MODEL.md
- /docs/handoff/latest/PLUGIN_CONTRACTS.json
- /docs/handoff/latest/RIVE_ASSISTANT.md
- /docs/handoff/latest/TODO_WARP_MOBILE.md

GIT PUBLISH (NO PAUSES):
1) Ensure git initialized.
2) Ensure branch handoff exists and is checked out.
3) Commit all changes (code + docs).
4) Push branch handoff to origin.

DELIVERABLE:
A runnable Expo prototype + backend + complete handoff in repo MŪVM on branch handoff.
No questions.

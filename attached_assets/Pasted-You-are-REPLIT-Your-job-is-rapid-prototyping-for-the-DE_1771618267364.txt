You are REPLIT. Your job is rapid prototyping for the DESKTOP app in repo: MŪVD.
You must NOT do final productization. You must NOT pause for confirmation. Execute end-to-end.

REPO / GIT RULE (MANDATORY):
- Target repo name: MŪVD
- Use the existing git remote "origin" if present (preferred).
- If origin is missing, create the repo under my connected Git account with name "MŪVD", then set origin to it.
- Always publish your handoff to branch: handoff
- Always generate /docs/handoff/latest/* and /docs/handoff/latest/HANDOFF_MANIFEST.json before pushing.
- Do not stop for permissions.

DESKTOP TARGET:
Desktop shell (Tauri preferred; Electron fallback) hosting a web UI.
Goal: demonstrate “Speak it into existence” + Kernel/Plugins + Evidence + Pins + Portfolio + Rive animated AI professor (Option A).

STACK (Prototype):
- UI: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Desktop shell: Tauri preferred (Electron fallback if necessary)
- DB: SQLite + Prisma
- Backend: Next.js route handlers (or minimal Node server)
- AI: Orchestrator STUB (deterministic planner + calls into plugin modules). Real OpenAI integration deferred to Warp.

CORE (KERNEL) MUST EXIST:
- Learner
- Concept, LearningGraphEdge
- CourseBlueprint, CourseRun
- MasteryState (score, stability, last_demonstrated_at)
- WeakPoint (typed, severity, signals, evidence_refs)
- EvidenceArtifact (hash placeholder, integrity signals, retention policy, tags, metrics)
- PortfolioItem (references evidence artifacts; core-controlled)
- Pin (deferred curiosity tokens)
- EventLog (event envelope)

PLUGIN MODULES (BEHIND STRICT CONTRACTS):
Implement as interfaces now (local implementations are fine):
1) quiz_engine.v1:
   - quiz.create(...)
   - quiz.grade(...)
2) game_engine.v1:
   - game.generate(...)
   - game.report_outcome(...)
3) search_ingestion.v1:
   - ingest.create_evidence_pack(...)
   - ingest.update_evidence_pack(...)

VOICE / SPEAK UX (Desktop Prototype):
- Implement “Speak” screen with:
  - Text transcript input (simulates voice)
  - Plan preview (3–8 steps)
  - Execute (runs orchestrator plan and calls plugins)
- Add “Pin it for later” button and voice phrase support (typed).

RIVE ASSISTANT (OPTION A):
- Add Rive state-machine professor in a right-side panel.
- Required states: idle, listening, thinking, speaking, celebrate, pin_ack(optional).
- Required inputs: isListening(bool), isThinking(bool), isSpeaking(bool), didSucceed(trigger), didPin(trigger).
- Bind states to orchestrator lifecycle.

DESKTOP UI SCREENS:
- Dashboard
- Speak (transcript -> plan -> execute)
- Learn (course viewer)
- Quiz Runner (plugin view)
- Game Runner (plugin view)
- Evidence (artifact list + replay logs)
- Portfolio (derived from accepted evidence)
- Pins

LOGIC:
- WeakPoint detection rules after quiz/game outcomes.
- Mastery deltas: plugins propose; kernel accepts via deterministic V1 rules.
- Evidence artifacts always created for quiz/game/evidence packs.

HANDOFF DOCS (REQUIRED):
Write:
- /docs/handoff/latest/HANDOFF_MANIFEST.json
- /docs/handoff/latest/DESKTOP_ARCHITECTURE.md
- /docs/handoff/latest/KERNEL_DATA_MODEL.md
- /docs/handoff/latest/PLUGIN_CONTRACTS.json (manifests + strict schemas)
- /docs/handoff/latest/EVENT_SCHEMA.md
- /docs/handoff/latest/SECURITY_PERMISSIONS.md (scopes + invariants)
- /docs/handoff/latest/RIVE_ASSISTANT.md (state machine + bindings)
- /docs/handoff/latest/TODO_WARP_DESKTOP.md

GIT PUBLISH (NO PAUSES):
1) Ensure git initialized.
2) Ensure branch handoff exists and is checked out.
3) Commit all changes (code + docs).
4) Push branch handoff to origin.

DELIVERABLE:
A runnable desktop prototype + complete handoff in repo MŪVD on branch handoff.
No questions.
